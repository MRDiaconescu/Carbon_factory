# Carbon_factory

This program creates a design for making carbon bonds, according to the model defined by Johannes Diderik van der Waals.
Classes are linked to each other by connections that exist in the deepest level of subclasses and classes and functions alike.
Methods can be created at this level to represent the interaction between the classes of TinyCell.
